### Deployment

1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/proffapt/scmb
   cd scmb/
   ```
2. Install `docker` and `docker-compose`
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose 
   ```
3. Create `.env` file. Copy the `.env.example` as `.env` and fill out the values for ENVs. Following is an exmple:
   ```env
   POSTGRES_DB=scmb
   POSTGRES_USER=postgres
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres-scmb-db
   HASH_SALT=bcrypt_hash_salt
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=jwt_secret
   ```
4. Build the docker images
   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose build
   ```
5. Run the containers using `docker-compose`
   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose up -d
   ```
